# Popular Movies, Stage 2

## Project Overview
Most of us can relate to kicking back on the couch and enjoying
a movie with friends and family. In this project, you‚Äôll build an app
to allow users to discover the most popular movies playing.

This app uses the API from [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/)

## API Key Note
**Define key in build.gradle**

Find a file named `gradle.properties` in `.gradle` folder in your home directory.

Add `PopularMoviesApp_ApiKey = "YOUR-API-KEY"` to that file.

## Why this Project

To become an Android developer, you must know how to bring particular 
mobile experiences to life. Specifically, you need to know how to build 
clean and compelling user interfaces (UIs), fetch data from network services, 
and optimize the experience for various mobile devices. You will hone these 
fundamental skills in this project.

By building this app, you will demonstrate your understanding of the 
foundational elements of programming for Android. Your app will communicate with 
the Internet and provide a responsive and delightful user experience.

## What I learned
- Fetch data from the Internet with theMovieDB API
- Use adapters and custom list layouts to populate list views
- Incorporate libraries to simplify the amount of code you need to write
- Build a fully featured application that looks and feels natural on the latest Android operating system.
